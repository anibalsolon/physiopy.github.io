<h1 id="how-to-contribute-to-physiopy"><a href="#contributorfile">How to contribute to <code>physiopy</code></a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the <code>physiopy</code> organisation! It's great news that you're
thinking about contributing!</p>
<p>Working with many people from many different places is great, but
sometimes this means that code can become messy due to the many
different ways a contribution can be made. For this reason, we have set
up some guidelines for contributions - to help you get involved ASAP! If
you lack knowledge in python development / github use / physiological
data handling, don't be scared! Try to jump in anyway. Most of the
original contributors learned these things exactly this way - jumping in
and hoping to fall in the right way without breaking too many bones. Do
you want to jump in but don't exactly know where/how? You can drop a few
lines in <a href="https://gitter.im/phys2bids/community">gitter</a>, so we can help
you find something that suits you! Already know what you\'re looking for
in this guide? Jump to the following sections:</p>

<h1 id="aims-of-physiopy"><a href="#aims">Aims of physiopy</a></h1>
<p><code>physiopy</code> is a <strong>very</strong> young project developed by a bunch of
researchers from the two different sides of the Atlantic Ocean (for
now). Our main goal is to help collect, analyse and share physiological
data, interfacing with (MRI) neuroimaging. We're trying to do so by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing packages to make a user-friendly pipeline to deal with
    physiological data.</li>
<li>Writing packages that take into account the use of this
    physiological data in combination with neuroimaging (MRI) analysis.</li>
<li>Providing documentation containing tips and strategies on how to
    collect such data and use our packages.</li>
<li>Help set a standard for these data, albeit without forcing users to
    use it.</li>
<li>Be an excuse for educational purposes on topics like Git/GitHub,
    Python3, physiology and related tools/topics.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="joining-the-conversation"><a href="#joinconvo">Joining the conversation</a></h2>
<p>We're trying to keep all conversation related to project development in
GitHub <a href="https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids/issues">issues</a>. We
maintain a <a href="https://gitter.im/physiopy/community">gitter chat room</a> for
more informal conversations and general project updates. We also have a
dev call once a month - specifically the second Thursday of the month!
If you want to participate, drop a line in gitter! When interacting in
the common channels, please adhere to our <a href="conduct.html">code of
conduct</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contributions"><a href="#contributiontypes">Contributions</a></h2>
<h3 id="contributing-with-small-documentation-changes"><a href="#smalldocs">Contributing with small documentation changes</a></h3>
<p>If you are new to GitHub and just have a small documentation change
recommendation (such as: typos detection, small improvements in the
content, ...), please open an issue in the relative project, and label
it with the "Documentation" label. Chances are those types of changes
are easily doable with GitHub\'s online editor, which means you can do
them, or ask for help from the developers!</p>
<h3 id="contributing-with-user-testing"><a href="#usertests">Contributing with User testing</a></h3>
<p>Another, non-coding friendly way to contribute to <code>physiopy</code> is by
testing the packages. There are different kinds of tests, but to
simplify things you can think mainly about automatic tests and user
tests. To know more about <strong>Automatic tests</strong>, you can read the <a href="#testing">testing
section</a>. <strong>User testing</strong> are warm, human, emotional and
opinionated tests that not only check that the code is doing what it
needs to do, but also whether there's a better way to do it - namely
better reports, clearer screen outputs, warnings and exceptions,
unexpected bugs that have to be corrected. If you want to perform one,
open an issue on GitHub or drop a comment in Gitter, refer to this
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b6wc7JVDs3vi-2IqGg_Ed_oWKbZ6siboAJHf55nodKo/edit?usp=sharing">blueprint</a>
and don't be afraid to ask questions!</p>
<h3 id="contributing-with-test-files"><a href="#testfile">Contributing with test files</a></h3>
<p>At <code>physiopy</code> we always try to imagine and support every possible
setting out there. However, our imagination has a limit - but if you
think our packages should process a specific format/setting that you
have, we're more than glad to do so! To make it happen, we need an
example of the file we want to process, so you will have to share it
with us (and the rest of the world)! The contribution can be a full file
of data that you already acquired, a part of that file (pay attention to
what is the minimum you need to share!), or mock data. The file
contribution should come with a json file of the same name that contains
the necessary information to run <code>phys2bids</code> on that file contribution.
There is a <a href="https://mfr.de-1.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/jrnxv/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render">json blueprint in
OSF</a>,
you can download it and adapt it. Note that the frequency list <strong>has to
be expressed in Hz</strong> as an integer or float. To contribute with a test
file, open an Issue in GitHub and label it with <em>Test</em>. We'll help you
add the file in our <a href="https://osf.io/3txqr/">OSF</a> space. We're extremely
grateful for this type of contribution - so grateful that we asked
allcontributors to add a dedicated category!</p>
<h3 id="contributing-documentation-through-github"><a href="#documenting">Contributing documentation through GitHub</a></h3>
<p>We use <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">readthedocs</a> to create our
documentation. Every contribution is welcome and it follows the same
steps as a code contribution, explained below.</p>
<h3 id="contributing-code-through-github"><a href="#code">Contributing code through GitHub</a></h3>
<p>This section covers 90% of the contributions a project like <code>physiopy</code>
receives - code, documentation and tests. The best way to make this kind
of contribution, in a nutshell, is to: 1. Open an issue with the
intended modifications. 2. Label it, discuss it, (self-)assign it. 3.
Open a Pull Request (PR) to resolve the issue and label it. 4. Wait for
a review, discuss it or comply, repeat until ready. Issues and PR chats
are great to maintain track of the conversation on the contribution.
They are based upon GitHub-flavoured
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a>. GitHub has a
helpful page on <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github">getting started with writing and formatting Markdown on
GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3 id="contributing-with-pull-requests-reviews"><a href="#reviews">Contributing with Pull Requests Reviews</a></h3>
<p>A big challenge of software development is merging code accurately
without having to wait too much time. For this reason, Reviewers for PRs
are more than welcome! It is a task that requires some experience, but
it's very necessary! Read the <a href="#reviewing">related section below</a> to
start!</p>
<h2 id="issues-and-milestones"><a href="#issuesmilestones">Issues and Milestones</a></h2>
<p>At <code>physiopy</code>, we use Issues and Milestones to keep track of and
organise our workflow.  <strong>Issues</strong> describe pieces of work that need to
be completed to move the project forwards. We try to keep them as simple
and clear as possible: an issue should describe a unitary, possibly
small piece of work (unless it's about refactoring). Don't be scared of
opening many issues at once, if it makes sense! Just check that what
you're proposing is not listed in a previous issue (open or closed) yet
(we don't like doubles). Issues get labelled. That helps the
contributors to know what they're about. Check the label list to know
what types are there, and use them accordingly! Issues can also be
<strong>assigned</strong>. If you want to work on an assigned issue, ask permission
first! - <strong>Milestones</strong> set the higher level workflow. They sketch
deadlines and important releases. Issues are assigned to these
milestones by the maintainers. If you feel that an issue should be
assigned to a specific milestone but the maintainers have not done so,
discuss it in the issue chat or in Gitter! We might have just missed it,
or we might not (yet) see how it aligns with the overall project
structure/milestone.</p>
<h2 id="labels"><a href="#labeltypes">Labels</a></h2>
<p>The current list of labels are
<a href="https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids/labels">here</a>. They can be used
for <strong>Issues</strong>, <strong>PRs</strong>, or both. We use
<a href="https://github.com/intuit/auto">auto</a> to automate our semantic
versioning and Pypi upload, so <strong>it\'s extremely important to use the
right PR labels</strong>!</p>
<h3 id="issue-pr-labels"><a href="#issueprlabels">Issue &amp; PR labels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Documentation: Improvements or additions to documentation. This
    category includes (but is not limited to) docs pages, docstrings,
    and code comments.</li>
<li>Duplicate: Whatever this is, it exists already! Maybe it's a closed
    Issue/PR, that should be reopened.</li>
<li>Enhancement: New features added or requested. This normally goes
    with a <code>minormod</code> label for PRs.</li>
<li>Outreach: As part of the scientific community, we care about
    outreach. Check the relevant section about it, but know that this
    Issue/PR contains information or tasks about abstracts, talks,
    demonstrations, papers.</li>
<li>Paused: Issue or PR should not be worked on until the resolution of
    other issues or PRs.</li>
<li>Testing: This is for testing features, writing tests or producing
    testing code. Both user testing and CI testing!</li>
<li>Urgent: If you don\'t know where to start, start here! This is
    probably related to a milestone due soon!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="issue-only-labels"><a href="#issuelabel">Issue-only labels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Bug: Something isn't working. It either breaks the code or has an
    unexpected outcome.</li>
<li>Community: This issue contains information about the <code>physiopy</code>
    community (e.g. the next developer call)</li>
<li>Discussion: Discussion of a concept or implementation. These Issues
    are prone to be open ad infinitum. Jump in the conversation if you
    want!</li>
<li>Good first issue: Good for newcomers. These issues calls for a
    <strong>fairly</strong> easy enhancement, or for a change that helps/requires
    getting to know the code better. They have educational value, and
    for this reason, unless urgent, experts in the topic should refrain
    from closing them - but help newcomers closing them.</li>
<li>Hacktoberfest: Dedicated to the hacktoberfest event, so that people
    can help and feel good about it (and show it with a T-shirt!).
    <strong>Such commits will not be recognised in the all-contributor table,
    unless otherwise specified</strong>.</li>
<li>Help wanted: Extra attention is needed here! It's a good place to
    have a look!</li>
<li>Refactoring: Improve nonfunctional attributes. Which means rewriting
    the code or the documentation to improve performance or just because
    there's a better way to express those lines. It might create a
    <code>majormod</code> PR.</li>
<li>Question: Further information is requested, from users to
    developers. Try to respond to this!</li>
<li>Wontfix: This will not be worked on, until further notice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pr-only-labels"><a href="#prlabel">PR-only labels</a></h3>
<h4 id="labels-for-semantic-release-and-changelogs">Labels for semantic release and changelogs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Majormod: These PRs call for a new major release (+1.0.0). This
    means that the PR is breaking backward compatibility.</li>
<li>Minormod: These PRs call for a new minor release (0.+1.0). This
    means that the PR is <strong>not</strong> breaking backward compatibility.</li>
<li>BugFIX: These PRs close an issue labelled <code>bug</code>. They also increase
    the semantic versioning for fixes (+0.0.1).</li>

<h4 id="other-labels">Other labels</h4>
<ul>
<li>Invalid: These PRs don't seem right. They actually seem so not
    right that they won't be further processed. This label invalidates a
    Hacktoberfest contribution. If you think this is wrong, start a
    discussion in the relevant issue (or open one if missing). Reviewers
    are asked to give an explanation for the use of this label.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="good-first-issues"><a href="#g1i">Good First Issues</a></h3>
<p>Good First Issues are issues that are either very simple, or that help
the contributor get to know the programs or the languages better. We use
it to help contributors with less experience to learn and familiarise
with Git, GitHub, Python3, and physiology. We invite more expert
contributors to avoid those issues, leave them to beginners and possibly
help them out in the resolution of the issue. However, if the issue is
left unassigned or unattended for long, and it's considered important or
urgent, anyone can tackle it.</p>
<h2 id="contribution-workflow"><a href="#workflow">Contribution workflow</a></h2>
<p>There are many descriptions of a good contribution workflow out there.
For instance, we suggest to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-a-change">tedana's workflow</a>.
At <code>physiopy</code>, we follow a very similar workflow. The only three
differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see an open issue that you would like to work on, check if it
    is assigned. If it is, ask the assignee if they need help or want to
    be substituted before starting to work on it.</li>
<li>We ask you to test the code locally before merging it, and then, if
    possible, write some automatic tests for the code to be run in our
    Continuous Integration! Check the testing section below to know
    more.</li>
<li>We suggest opening a draft PR as soon as you can - so it's easier
    for us to help you!</li>
</ul>
<p>See our <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing">complete documentation</a> on the matter</p>
<h2 id="pull-requests"><a href="#pr">Pull Requests</a></h2>
<p>To improve understanding pull requests \"at a glance\" and use the power
of <code>auto</code>, we use the labels listed above. Multiple labels can be
assigned to a PR - in fact, all those that you think are relevant. We
strongly advise to keep the changes you\'re introducing with your PR
limited to your original goal. Adding to the scope of your PR little
style corrections or code refactoring here and there in the code that
you\'re already modifying is a great help, but when they become too much
(and they are not relevant to your PR) they risk complicating the nature
of the PR and the reviewing process. It is much better to open another
PR with the objective of doing such corrections! Moreover, if you\'re
tempted to assign more than one label that would trigger a release (e.g.
bug and minormod or bug and majormod, etc.), you might want to split your PR
instead. When opening a pull request, assign it at least one label.</p>
<p>We encourage you to open a PR as soon as possible - even before you
finish working on them. This is useful especially to you - so that you
can receive comments and suggestions early on, rather than having to
process a lot of comments in the final review step! However, if it's an
incomplete PR, please open a <strong>Draft PR</strong>. That helps us process PRs by
knowing which one to have a look first - and how picky to be when doing
so.</p>
<p>Reviewing PRs is a time consuming task and it can be stressful for both
the reviewer and the author. Avoiding wasting time and the need of
little fixes - such as fixing grammar mistakes and typos, styling code,
or adopting conventions - is a good start for a successful (and quick)
review. Before graduating a Draft PR to a PR ready for review, please
check that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You did all you wanted to include in your PR. If at a later stage
    you realize something is missing and it's not a minor thing, you
    will need to open a new PR.</li>
<li>If your contribution contains code or tests, you ran and passed all
    of the tests locally with <a href="#testing">pytest</a>.</li>
<li>If you're writing documentation, you built it locally with
    sphinx and the format is what you intended.</li>
<li>Your code is harmonious with the rest of the code - no repetitions
    of any sort!</li>
</ul>
<p>Your code respects the <a href="#styling">adopted Style</a>, especially if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your code is lintered adequately and respects the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> convention.</li>
<li>Your docstrings follow the <a href="https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html">numpydoc</a> convention.</li>
<li>
<p>There are no typos or grammatical mistakes and the text is fluid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code is sufficiently commented and the comments are clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your PR title is clear enough to be meaningful when appended to the version changelog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have the correct labels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="to-be-merged-prs-have-to">To be merged, PRs have to:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Pass all the CircleCI tests, and possibly all the codecov checks.</li>
<li>
<p>Have the necessary amount of approving reviews, even if you're a
    long time contributor.</p>
<p>Note : You can ask one (or more) contributor to do
that review, if you think they align more with the content of your
PR. You need <strong>one</strong> review for documentation, tests, and small
changes, and <strong>two</strong> reviews for bugs, refactoring and enhancements.
3.  Have at least a release-related label (or a <code>Skip
release</code> label).
4.  Have a short title that clearly explains in one sentence the aim of
the PR.
5.  Contain at least a unit test for your contribution, if the PR
contains code (it would be better if it contains an integration or
function test and all the breaking tests necessary). If you're not
confident about writing tests, it is possible to refer to an issue
that asks for the test to be written, or another (Draft) PR that
contains the tests required.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As we're trying to maintain at least 90% code coverage, you're strongly
encouraged to write all of the tests necessary to keep coverage above
that threshold. If coverage drops too low, you might be asked to add
more tests and/or your PR might be rejected. See the <a href="#testing">Automatic testing</a> section.</p>
<p>Don't merge your own pull request! That\'s a task for the main reviewer
of your PR or the project manager. Remember that the project manager
doesn't have to be a reviewer of your PR!</p>
<h2 id="reviewing-prs"><a href="#reviewing">Reviewing PRs</a></h2>
<p>Reviewing PRs is an extremely important task in collaborative
development. In fact, it is probably the task that requires the most
time in the development, and it can be stressful for both the reviewer
and the author. Remember that, as a PR Reviewer, you are guaranteeing
that the changes work and integrate well with the rest of the
repository, hence <strong>you are responsible for the quality of the
repository and its next version release</strong>. If they don\'t integrate
well, later PR reviewers might have to ask for broader changes than
expected.</p>
<p>There are many best practices to review code online, for
instance <a href="https://medium.com/an-idea/the-code-review-guide-9e793edcd683">this medium blog post</a>, but
here are some good rules of thumbs that we need to follow while
reviewing PRs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be <strong>respectful</strong> to the PR authors and be clear in what you are
    asking/suggesting - remember that, like you, they are contributing
    their spare time and doing their best job!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is a <em>Draft PR</em>, you can comment on its development in the
    message board or making "Comment" reviews. Don't ask for changes,
    and especially, <strong>don't approve the PR</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the PR graduated <em>from Draft to full PR</em>, check that it follows the
    sections <a href="#pr">Pull requests</a> and <a href="#styling">Style Guide</a> of these
    guidelines. If not, invite the author to do so before starting a
    review.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Don't limit your review to the parts that are changed</strong>. Look at
    the entire file, see if the changes fit well in it, and see if the
    changes are properly addressed everywhere in the code - in the
    documentation, in the tests, and in other functions. Sometimes the
    differences reported don't show the full impact of the PR in the
    repository!</li>
<li>If your want to make Pull Requests an educational process, invite
    the author of the PR to make changes before actually doing them
    yourself. Request changes via comments or in the message board or by
    checking out the PR locally, making changes and then submitting a PR
    to the author's branch.</li>
<li>If you decide to use the suggestion tool in reviews, or to start a
    PR to the branch under review, please alert the Project Manager.
    Bots might automatically assign you contribution types that will
    have to be removed (remember, your contribution in this case is
    "Reviewer"). Instead of starting a PR to the branch under review,
    think about opening a new PR with those modifications (unless they
    are needed to pass tests), and alert the Main Reviewer. In any case
    <strong>don't commit directly to the branch under review</strong>!</li>
<li>If you're reviewing documentation, build it locally with <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html"><code>sphinx-build</code></a> command.</li>
<li>If you're asking for changes, <strong>don't approve the PR</strong>. Approve it
    only after everything was sufficiently addressed. Someone else might
    merge the PR in taking your word for granted.</li>
<li>If you are the main reviewer, and the last reviewer required to
    approve the PR, merge the PR!</li>
</ul>
<p>Before approving and/or merging PRs, be sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the tests in CircleCI/Azure pass without errors.</li>
<li>Prefereably, codecov checks pass as well. If they don\'t, discuss
    what to do.</li>
<li>The title describes the content of the PR clearly enough to be
    meaningful on its own - remember that it will appear in the version
    changelog!</li>
<li>The PR has the appropriate labels to trigger the appropriate version
    release and update the contributors table.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="main-reviewer"><a href="#mainreviewer">Main reviewer</a></h3>
<p>At <code>physiopy</code> we use the <em>Assignees</em> section of a PR to mark the
<strong>main reviewer</strong> for that PR. The main reviewer is the primary person
responsible <strong>for the quality of the repository and its next version release</strong>,
 as well as <strong>for the behaviour of the other reviewers</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>The main reviewer takes care of the reviewing process of the PR, in particular:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Invites the reviewers to finish their review in a relatively
    short time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checks that all elements of this document were respected,
    especially the part about <a href="#pr">Pull Requests</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invites other Reviewers to respect this document, especially
    the part about <a href="#reviewing">reviews</a>, helps them in doing
    so, and checks that they do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a Reviewer keeps not respecting this document, flags them
    to the project manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decides what to do in case of a coverage decrease (in
    <em>codecov/patch</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>In case of missing tests or updates to user documentation:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Asks for more documentation or tests before approving the
    PR, <em>or</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checks that the appropriate issues have been opened to
    address the lack of documentation or tests (1 issue per item), <em>or</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double-checks that the title is clear and the labels are correct to
    trigger an appropriate <code>auto</code> release - feel free to change them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Main reviewer <strong>Is the one that is going to merge the PR.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>After the PR has been merged and a new release has been triggered, checks that:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The documentation was updated correctly (if changed).</li>
<li>The Pypi version of the repository coincides with the new release (if changed).</li>
<li>New contributors or forms of contributions were correctly added in the README (if changed).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="style-guide"><a href="#styling">Style Guide</a></h2>
<p>Docstrings should follow
<a href="https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html">numpydoc</a>
convention. We encourage extensive documentation. The python code itself
should follow <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a>
convention whenever possible: there are continuous integration tests
checking that! You can use linters to help you write your code following
style conventions. Linters are add-ons that you can run on the written
script file. We suggest the use of <strong>flake8</strong> for Python 3. Many editors
(Atom, VScode, Sublimetext, ...) support addons for online lintering,
which means you'll see warnings and errors while you write the code -
check out if your does!</p>
<p>Since we adopt <a href="https://intuit.github.io/auto/home.html">auto</a>, the PR
title will be automatically reported as part of the changelog when
updating versions. Try to describe in one (short) sentence what your PR
is about - possibly using the imperative and starting with a capital
letter. For instance, a good PR title could be:
<code>Implement support for &lt;randomtype&gt; files</code> or
<code>Reorder dictionary entries</code>, rather than <code>&lt;randomtype&gt; support</code> or
<code>reorders keys</code>.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-testing"><a href="#testing">Automatic Testing</a></h2>
<p><code>physiopy</code> uses Continuous Integration (CI) to make life easier. In
particular, we use the <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a> platform to run
automatic testing! <strong>Automatic tests</strong> are cold, robotic, emotionless,
and opinionless tests that check that the program is doing what it is
expected to. They are written by the developers and run (by CircleCI)
every time they send a Pull Request to <code>physiopy</code> repositories. They
complement the warm, human, emotional and opinionated <strong>user tests</strong>, as
they tell us if a piece of code is failing. CircleCI uses
<a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> to run the tests. The great
thing about it is that you can run it in advance on your local version
of the code! We can measure the amount of code that is tested with
<a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">codecov</a>, which is an indication of
how reliable our packages are! We try to maintain a 90% code coverage,
and for this reason, PR should contain tests! The four main type of
tests we use are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unit tests :</p>
<pre><code>Unit tests check that a minimal piece of code is doing what it
should be doing. Normally this means calling a function with
some mock parameters and checking that the output is equal to
the expected output. For example, to test a function that adds
two given numbers together (1 and 3), we would call the function
with those parameters, and check that the output is 4.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaking tests</p>
<pre><code>Breaking tests are what you expect - they check that the program
is breaking when it should. This means calling a function with
parameters that are expected **not** to work, and check that it
raises a proper error or warning.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration tests</p>
<pre><code>Integration tests check that the code has an expected output,
being blind to its content. This means that if the program
should output a new file, the file exists - even if it's empty.
This type of tests are normally run on real data and call the
program itself. For instance, documentation PRs should check
that the documentation page is produced!
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functional tests</p>
<pre><code>If integration tests and unit tests could have babies, those
would be functional tests. In practice, this kind of tests check
that an output is produced, and *also* that it contains what it
should contain. If a function should output a new file or an
object, this test passes only if the file exists *and* it is
like we expect it to be. They are run on real or mock data, and
call the program itself or a function.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
